# Flux Architecture

Here we are collecting metadata and intending to create visualizations of the architecture.

## Desired Steps

1. First, we need to define components, plugins, modules, and projects under [_data](_data)
2. From that, we'd like to make:
  a. A "legos" design searchable table or UI to be able to quickly browse and find a component and a link to where it is.
  b. A circle packing plot that shows where plugins/modules live based on projects (for informational purposes)
  c. Architecture diagrams of several types

**under development**
