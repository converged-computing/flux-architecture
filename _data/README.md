# Data

The following files contain the following (wow that's a terrible sentence):

 - [projects.yaml](projects.yaml) is metadata about projects
 - [modules.yaml](modules.yaml) currently includes descriptions of different kinds of moduels (mainly broker)
 - [components.yaml](components.yaml) defines top level groups for modules and plugins, and provides a lookup for the other files (e.g., I can lookup what a "broker-module" is.
