    By default, a Flux system instance treats users equally and schedules work based on demand,
    without consideration of a userâ€™s history of resource consumption, or what share of available
    resources their organization considers they should be entitled to use relative to other competing users.
    Flux-accounting adds a database which stores site policy, banks with with user/project associations, 
    and metrics representing historical usage.

    The Flux RESTful API can be used to programmatically interact with Flux,
    via REST. As an example, the Flux Operator can deploy the API to your cluster,
    and users can submit jobs to Kubernetes programatically using it. It is not
    limited to Kubernetes, however. The API can be provided alongside a Flux
    installation to give a different kind of programmatic access to user scripts.
    Additionally, it provides authentication and an OAauth2 style flow if desired.
