    By default, a Flux system instance treats users equally and schedules work based on demand,
    without consideration of a userâ€™s history of resource consumption, or what share of available
    resources their organization considers they should be entitled to use relative to other competing users.
    Flux-accounting adds a database which stores site policy, banks with with user/project associations, 
    and metrics representing historical usage. It also adds a Flux jobtap plugin that sets the priority 
    on each job that enters the system based on multiple factors including fair share values. 
    The priority determines the order in which jobs are considered by the scheduler for resource 
    allocation. In addition, the jobtap plugin holds or rejects job requests that exceed 
    user/project specific limits or have exhausted their bank allocations.

    The database is populated and queried with command line tools prefixed
    with flux account. Accounting scripts are run regularly by flux-cron(1) to pull 
    historical job information from the Flux job-archive database to the accounting database, 
    and to push bank and limit data to the jobtap plugin.

    At this time, the database is expected to be installed on a cluster management node, 
    co-located with the rank 0 Flux broker, managing accounts for that cluster only. 
    Sites would typically populate the database and keep it up to date automatically
    using information regularly pulled or pushed from an external source like an identity management system.

    The Flux RESTful API can be used to programmatically interact with Flux,
    via REST. As an example, the Flux Operator can deploy the API to your cluster,
    and users can submit jobs to Kubernetes programatically using it. It is not
    limited to Kubernetes, however. The API can be provided alongside a Flux
    installation to give a different kind of programmatic access to user scripts.
    Additionally, it provides authentication and an OAauth2 style flow if desired.
